                               # netcat_enhanced.py
Similar to netcat but more advanced. 

                                How to Use:

* Save: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., netcat_enhanced.py).

* Make Executable (Linux): chmod +x netcat_enhanced.py

* Run:

-Server (Regular): ./netcat_enhanced.py -l -p 8080

-Server (SSL): ./netcat_enhanced.py -l -p 8080 -s --certfile cert.pem --keyfile key.pem

-Client (Regular): ./netcat_enhanced.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080

-Client (SSL): ./netcat_enhanced.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -s

-Execute Command: ./netcat_enhanced.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -e "ls -l"

-File Upload: ./netcat_enhanced.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -u "uploaded_file.txt" (client sends the file content)

-Command Shell: ./netcat_enhanced.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -c

                                  Improvements and Explanations:

* SSL Support: Added -s or --ssl flag. The server can use --certfile and --keyfile to load a certificate and key. If not provided, a default context is used (but this isn't recommended for real use). The client also uses SSL if enabled.

* Command Execution (-e): The -e option now executes a command on the target system and sends the output back to the client. This is a significant enhancement.

* File Upload (-u): The -u option lets you upload a file to the target system. The server receives the file content and saves it. It also sends confirmation messages.

* Command Shell (-c): The -c option starts an interactive command shell on the target system. This is a persistent connection where you can type commands and see their output. Added a custom prompt (netcat-enhanced>) to make it clearer.

* Interactive Shell (Default): If no other options are given, it defaults to the original netcat behavior (transferring data between two endpoints). Standard input is now checked with sys.stdin.isatty() to only display a prompt when appropriate (it won't prompt when piping data).

* Threading: Uses threading to handle multiple clients concurrently on the server. This makes the server much more useful.

* Error Handling: Improved error handling with try...except blocks to catch and report errors.

* Clearer Output: Improved output messages and prompts.

* Argument Parsing: Uses argparse for more robust and user-friendly command-line argument handling.

* Increased Backlog: The server now uses server_socket.listen(5) to allow it to handle more simultaneous connections.

* No Empty Commands: The command shell now ignores empty commands.
